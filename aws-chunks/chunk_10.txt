Amazon Textract also provides asynchronous operations to extend support to multipage documents. Amazon Textract's API operations have quotas that limit how quickly and how often you can use them. If the limit set for your account is frequently exceeded, you can request a limit increase. To change a limit, select the Amazon Textract option in the Service Quotas console. You can use the Quotas Calculator in the Amazon Textract console to determine your quota requirements.
