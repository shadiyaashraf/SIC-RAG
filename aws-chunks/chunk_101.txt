Access control lists (ACLs) You can use ACLs to grant read and write permissions to authorized users for individual general purpose buckets and objects. Each general purpose bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a subresource. The ACL defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. ACLs are an access control mechanism that predates IAM. For more information about ACLs, see Access control list (ACL) overview
