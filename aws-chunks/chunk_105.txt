Regions You can choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 stores the buckets that you create. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in an AWS Region never leave the Region unless you explicitly transfer or replicate them to another Region. For example, objects stored in the Europe (Ireland) Region never leave it. Note
You can access Amazon S3 and its features only in the AWS Regions that are enabled for your account.
