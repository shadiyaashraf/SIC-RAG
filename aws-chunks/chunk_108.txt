In addition, read operations on Amazon S3 Select, Amazon S3 access controls lists (ACLs), Amazon S3 Object Tags, and object metadata (for example, the HEAD object) are strongly consistent. Updates to a single key are atomic. For example, if you make a PUT request to an existing key from one thread and perform a GET request on the same key from a second thread concurrently, you will get either the old data or the new data, but never partial or corrupt data. Amazon S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within AWS data centers. If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely stored.
