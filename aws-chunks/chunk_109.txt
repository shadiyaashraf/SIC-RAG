Amazon S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within AWS data centers. If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely stored. Any read (GET or LIST request) that is initiated following the receipt of a successful PUT response will return the data written by the PUT request. Here are examples of this behavior: A process writes a new object to Amazon S3 and immediately lists keys within its bucket. The new object appears in the list.
