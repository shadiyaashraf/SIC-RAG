A process deletes an existing object and immediately lists keys within its bucket. The object does not appear in the listing. Note Amazon S3 does not support object locking for concurrent writers. If two PUT requests are simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the latest timestamp wins. If this is an issue, you must build an object-locking mechanism into your application.
