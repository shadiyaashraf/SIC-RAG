There is no way to make atomic updates across keys. For example, you cannot make the update of one key dependent on the update of another key unless you design this functionality into your application. Bucket configurations have an eventual consistency model. Specifically, this means that: If you delete a bucket and immediately list all buckets, the deleted bucket might still appear in the list. If you enable versioning on a bucket for the first time, it might take a short amount of time for the change to be fully propagated.
