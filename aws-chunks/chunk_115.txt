Specifically, this means that: If you delete a bucket and immediately list all buckets, the deleted bucket might still appear in the list. If you enable versioning on a bucket for the first time, it might take a short amount of time for the change to be fully propagated. We recommend that you wait for 15 minutes after enabling versioning before issuing write operations (PUT or DELETE requests) on objects in the bucket. Concurrent applications This section provides examples of behavior to be expected from Amazon S3 when multiple clients are writing to the same items. In this example, both W1 (write 1) and W2 (write 2) finish before the start of R1 (read 1) and R2 (read 2).
