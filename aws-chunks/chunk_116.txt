Concurrent applications This section provides examples of behavior to be expected from Amazon S3 when multiple clients are writing to the same items. In this example, both W1 (write 1) and W2 (write 2) finish before the start of R1 (read 1) and R2 (read 2). Because S3 is strongly consistent, R1 and R2 both return color = ruby
. In the next example, W2 does not finish before the start of R1. Therefore, R1 might return color = ruby or color = garnet
.
