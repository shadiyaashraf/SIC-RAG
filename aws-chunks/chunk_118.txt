In the last example, W2 begins before W1 has received an acknowledgment. Therefore, these writes are considered concurrent. Amazon S3 internally uses last-writer-wins semantics to determine which write takes precedence. However, the order in which Amazon S3 receives the requests and the order in which applications receive acknowledgments cannot be predicted because of various factors, such as network latency. For example, W2 might be initiated by an Amazon EC2 instance in the same Region, while W1 might be initiated by a host that is farther away.
