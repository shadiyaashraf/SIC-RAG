Amazon S3 is a REST service. You can send requests to Amazon S3 using the AWS SDK libraries, which wrap the underlying Amazon S3 REST API and simplify your programming tasks. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as calculating signatures, cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for AWS
. Every interaction with Amazon S3 is either authenticated or anonymous.
