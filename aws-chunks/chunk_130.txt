You can even use a browser to fetch objects, as long as they are anonymously readable. The REST API uses standard HTTP headers and status codes, so that standard browsers and toolkits work as expected. In some areas, we have added functionality to HTTP (for example, we added headers to support access control). In these cases, we have done our best to add the new functionality in a way that matches the style of standard HTTP usage. If you make direct REST API calls in your application, you must write the code to compute the signature and add it to the request.
