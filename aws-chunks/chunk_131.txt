In these cases, we have done our best to add the new functionality in a way that matches the style of standard HTTP usage. If you make direct REST API calls in your application, you must write the code to compute the signature and add it to the request. For more information about how to make requests to Amazon S3, see Making requests in the Amazon S3 API Reference

SOAP API support over HTTP is deprecated, but it is still available over HTTPS. Newer Amazon S3 features are not supported for SOAP.
