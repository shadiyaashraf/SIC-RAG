Note
SOAP API support over HTTP is deprecated, but it is still available over HTTPS. Newer Amazon S3 features are not supported for SOAP. We recommend that you use either the REST API or the AWS SDKs. Paying for Amazon S3 Pricing for Amazon S3 is designed so that you don't have to plan for the storage requirements of your application. Most storage providers require you to purchase a predetermined amount of storage and network transfer capacity.
