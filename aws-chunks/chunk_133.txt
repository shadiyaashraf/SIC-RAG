Paying for Amazon S3 Pricing for Amazon S3 is designed so that you don't have to plan for the storage requirements of your application. Most storage providers require you to purchase a predetermined amount of storage and network transfer capacity. In this scenario, if you exceed that capacity, your service is shut off or you are charged high overage fees. If you do not exceed that capacity, you pay as though you used it all. Amazon S3 charges you only for what you actually use, with no hidden fees and no overage charges.
