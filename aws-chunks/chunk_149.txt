Grant permissions to an IAM user To grant permission to an IAM user within your account, you must provide an "AWS":"
user-ARN
" name-value pair. "Principal":
{
"AWS":"arn:aws:iam::
account-number-without-hyphens
:user/
username
"} For detailed examples that provide step-by-step instructions, see Example 1: Bucket owner granting its users bucket permissions and Example 3: Bucket owner granting permissions to objects it does not own
. Note
If an IAM identity is deleted after you update your bucket policy, the bucket policy will show a unique identifier in the principal element instead of an ARN. These unique IDs are never reused, so you can safely remove principals with unique identifiers from all of your policy statements. For more information about unique identifiers, see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide
