Then, change the permissions on your S3 data. In your bucket policy, you can set CloudFront as the Principal as follows: "Principal":
{
"Service":"cloudfront.amazonaws.com"} Use a Condition element in the policy to allow CloudFront to access the bucket only when the request is on behalf of the CloudFront distribution that contains the S3 origin. "Condition": { "StringEquals": { "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::
111122223333
:distribution/
CloudFront-distribution-ID
" } } For more information about requiring S3 access through CloudFront URLs, see Restricting access to an Amazon Simple Storage Service origin in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide
