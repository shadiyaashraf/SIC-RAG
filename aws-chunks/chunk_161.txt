One-to-many mapping. For example, to use the HeadObject API operation, the s3:GetObject is required. Also, when you use S3 Object Lock and want to get an object's Legal Hold status or retention settings, the corresponding s3:GetObjectLegalHold or s3:GetObjectRetention policy actions are also required before you can use the HeadObject API operation. Many-to-one mapping. For example, to use the ListObjectsV2 or HeadBucket API operations, the s3:ListBucket policy action is required.
