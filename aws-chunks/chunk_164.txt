, ListObjectsV2
, and PutBucketPolicy
. S3 policy actions for bucket operations require the Resource element in bucket policies or IAM identity-based policies to be the S3 bucket type Amazon Resource Name (ARN) identifier in the following example format. "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::
amzn-s3-demo-bucket
" The following bucket policy grants the user Akua with account 12345678901 the s3:ListBucket permission to perform the ListObjectsV2 API operation and list objects in an S3 bucket. JSON { "Version":"2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "Allow Akua to list objects in the bucket", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::

" } ]
