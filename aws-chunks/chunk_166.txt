. In access point policies, S3 policy actions for bucket operations require you to use the access point ARN for the Resource element in the following format. "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:
us-west-2
:
123456789012
:accesspoint/
example-access-point
" The following access point policy grants the user Akua with account 12345678901 the s3:ListBucket permission to perform the ListObjectsV2 API operation through the S3 access point named example-access-point
. This permission allows Akua to list the objects in the bucket that's associated with example-access-point
. JSON { "Version":"2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "AllowAkuaToListObjectsInBucketThroughAccessPoint", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::
111122223333
:user/
Akua
" }, "Action": [ "s3:ListBucket" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:
us-west-2
:
111122223333
:accesspoint/
