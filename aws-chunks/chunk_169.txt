In access point policies, S3 policy actions for bucket operations require you to use the access point ARN for the Resource element in the following format. "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:
us-west-2
:
123456789012
:accesspoint/
example-access-point--usw2-az1--xa-s3

. This permission allows Akua to list the objects in the bucket that's associated with example-access-point--usw2-az1--xa-s3
. JSON { "Version":"2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "AllowAkuaToListObjectsInTheBucketThroughAccessPoint", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Akua" }, "Action": [ "s3:ListBucket" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3express:us-east-1:111122223333:accesspoint/example-access-point-usw2-az1-xa-s3" } ]
