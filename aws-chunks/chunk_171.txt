For example, GetObject
, PutObject
, and DeleteObject
. S3 policy actions for object operations require the Resource element in policies to be the S3 object ARN in the following example formats. "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::
amzn-s3-demo-bucket
/*" "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::
amzn-s3-demo-bucket
/
prefix
/*" Note
The object ARN must contain a forward slash after the bucket name, as seen in the previous examples. The following bucket policy grants the user Akua with account 12345678901 the s3:PutObject permission. This permission allows Akua to use the PutObject API operation to upload objects to the S3 bucket named amzn-s3-demo-bucket
.
