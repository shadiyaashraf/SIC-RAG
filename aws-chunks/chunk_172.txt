} Object operations in access point policies When you use S3 Access Points to control access to object operations, you can use access point policies. When you use access point policies, S3 policy actions for object operations require you to use the access point ARN for the Resource element in the following format: arn:aws:s3:
region
:
account-id
:accesspoint/
access-point-name
/object/
resource
. For object operations that use access points, you must include the /object/ value after the whole access point ARN in the Resource element.
