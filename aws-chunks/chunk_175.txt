. Object operations in policies for access points for directory buckets When you use access points for directory buckets to control access to object operations, you can use access point policies. When you use access point policies, S3 policy actions for object operations require you to use the access point ARN for the Resource element in the following format: arn:aws:s3:
region
:
account-id
:accesspoint/
access-point-name
/object/
resource
. For object operations that use access points, you must include the /object/ value after the whole access point ARN in the Resource element. Here are some examples.
