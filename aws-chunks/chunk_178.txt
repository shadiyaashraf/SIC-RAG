Access point for general purpose bucket operations Access point operations are S3 API operations that operate on the accesspoint resource type. For example, CreateAccessPoint
, DeleteAccessPoint
, and GetAccessPointPolicy
. S3 policy actions for access point operations can only be used in IAM identity-based policies, not in bucket policies or access point policies. Access points operations require the Resource element to be the access point ARN in the following example format. "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:
us-west-2
:
123456789012
:accesspoint/
example-access-point
" The following IAM identity-based policy grants the s3:GetAccessPointPolicy permission to perform the GetAccessPointPolicy API operation on the S3 access point named example-access-point
.
