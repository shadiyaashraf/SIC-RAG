:accesspoint/
example-access-point
" The following IAM identity-based policy grants the s3:GetAccessPointPolicy permission to perform the GetAccessPointPolicy API operation on the S3 access point named example-access-point
. JSON { "Version":"2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "GrantPermissionToRetrieveTheAccessPointPolicyOfAccessPointExampleAccessPoint", "Effect": "Allow", "Action": [ "s3:GetAccessPointPolicy" ], "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:*:
