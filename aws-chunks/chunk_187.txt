S3 policy actions for job operations can only be used in IAM identity-based policies, not in bucket policies. Also, job operations require the Resource element in IAM identity-based policies to be the job ARN in the following example format. "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:*:
123456789012
:job/*" The following IAM identity-based policy grants the s3:DescribeJob permission to perform the DescribeJob API operation on the S3 Batch Operations job named example-job
