Each Amazon S3 condition key maps to the same name request header allowed by the API on which the condition can be set. Amazon S3âspecific condition keys dictate the behavior of the same name request headers. For example, the condition key s3:VersionId used to grant conditional permission for the s3:GetObjectVersion permission defines behavior of the versionId query parameter that you set in a GET Object request.
