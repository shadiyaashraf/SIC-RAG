ABAC with Amazon S3 Supports ABAC (tags in policies): Partial Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes called tags. You can attach tags to IAM entities and AWS resources, then design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag on the resource. To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the aws:ResourceTag/
key-name
, aws:RequestTag/
key-name
, or aws:TagKeys condition keys. If a service supports all three condition keys for every resource type, then the value is Yes for the service. If a service supports all three condition keys for only some resource types, then the value is Partial
