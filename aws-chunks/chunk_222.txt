Request authorization ============================== Security best practices for Amazon S3
Important
Starting in April 2026, AWS will disable server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) for all new buckets. In addition, SSE-C encryption will be disabled for all existing buckets in AWS accounts that do not have any SSE-C encrypted data. With these changes, the few applications that need SSE-C encryption must deliberately enable the use SSE-C via the PutBucketEncryption API after creating the bucket. In these cases, you might need to update automation scripts, CloudFormation templates, or other infrastructure configuration tools to configure these settings.
