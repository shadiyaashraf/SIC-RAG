Disable access control lists (ACLs) S3 Object Ownership is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that you can use to control ownership of objects uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable ACLs. By default, Object Ownership is set to the bucket owner enforced setting and all ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to data exclusively using access management policies. A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of access control lists (ACLs)
. We recommend that you disable ACLs, except in circumstances where you must control access for each object individually.
