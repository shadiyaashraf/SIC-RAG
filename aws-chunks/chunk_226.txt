A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of access control lists (ACLs)
. We recommend that you disable ACLs, except in circumstances where you must control access for each object individually. To disable ACLs and take ownership of every object in your bucket, apply the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership. When you disable ACLs, you can easily maintain a bucket with objects uploaded by different AWS accounts. When ACLs are disabled access control for your data is based on policies, such as the following: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user policies S3 bucket policies Virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint policies AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) AWS Organizations resource control policies (RCPs) Disabling ACLs simplifies permissions management and auditing.
