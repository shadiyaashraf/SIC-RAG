When you disable ACLs, you can easily maintain a bucket with objects uploaded by different AWS accounts. When ACLs are disabled access control for your data is based on policies, such as the following: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user policies S3 bucket policies Virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint policies AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) AWS Organizations resource control policies (RCPs) Disabling ACLs simplifies permissions management and auditing. ACLs are disabled for new buckets by default. You can also disable ACLs for existing buckets. If you have an existing bucket that already has objects in it, after you disable ACLs, the object and bucket ACLs are no longer part of the access-evaluation process.
