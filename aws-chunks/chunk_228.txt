You can also disable ACLs for existing buckets. If you have an existing bucket that already has objects in it, after you disable ACLs, the object and bucket ACLs are no longer part of the access-evaluation process. Instead, access is granted or denied on the basis of policies. Before you disable ACLs, make sure that you do the following: Review your bucket policy to ensure that it covers all the ways that you intend to grant access to your bucket outside of your account. Reset your bucket ACL to the default (full control to the bucket owner).
