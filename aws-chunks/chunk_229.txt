Before you disable ACLs, make sure that you do the following: Review your bucket policy to ensure that it covers all the ways that you intend to grant access to your bucket outside of your account. Reset your bucket ACL to the default (full control to the bucket owner). After you disable ACLs, the following behaviors occur: Your bucket accepts only PUT requests that do not specify an ACL or PUT requests with bucket owner full control ACLs. These ACLs include the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL or equivalent forms of this ACL that are expressed in XML. Existing applications that support bucket owner full control ACLs see no impact.
