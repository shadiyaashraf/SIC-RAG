Use AWS Trusted Advisor to inspect your Amazon S3 implementation. Consider implementing ongoing detective controls by using the s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited and s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited managed AWS Config Rules. For organizations with multiple AWS accounts, consider using organization-level Block Public Access management: Centralized policy management: Use AWS Organizations to create a single S3 Block Public Access policy that automatically applies to all member accounts or selected organizational units (OUs). Automatic inheritance: When you attach the policy at the root or OU level, new member accounts automatically inherit the Block Public Access settings without individual account setup. Simplified compliance: Organization-level policies eliminate the need to maintain complex Service Control Policies (SCPs) for Block Public Access enforcement and reduce operational overhead of managing individual account configurations.
