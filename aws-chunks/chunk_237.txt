. Disable server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) to your buckets Most modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer use SSE-C because it lacks the flexibility of server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). SSE-C's requirement to provide the encryption key each time you interact with your SSE-C encrypted data makes it impractical to share your SSE-C key with other users, roles, or AWS services who read data from your S3 buckets in order to operate on your data. To limit the server-side encryption types you can use in your general purpose buckets, you can choose to block SSE-C write requests by updating your default encryption configuration for your buckets. This bucket-level configuration blocks requests to upload objects that specify SSE-C.
