For more information, see Creating a bucket that uses a GUID in the bucket name
. We recommend that you don't delete your buckets. All AWS Accounts now have a default bucket quota of 10,000 buckets, reducing the need to delete empty buckets from your account. If you delete a bucket, be aware that another AWS account in the same partition can use the same bucket name for a new bucket and can therefore potentially receive requests that are intended for the deleted bucket. If you want to prevent this, or if you want to continue to use the same bucket name, don't delete the bucket.
