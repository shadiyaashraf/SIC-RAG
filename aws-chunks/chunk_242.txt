If you delete a bucket, be aware that another AWS account in the same partition can use the same bucket name for a new bucket and can therefore potentially receive requests that are intended for the deleted bucket. If you want to prevent this, or if you want to continue to use the same bucket name, don't delete the bucket. We recommend that you empty the bucket and keep it. Instead of deleting the bucket, block any bucket requests as needed. For buckets no longer in active use, we recommend emptying the bucket of all objects to minimize costs while retaining the bucket itself.
