When you use a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a username and password or access keys) to an Amazon EC2 instance or AWS service, such as AWS Lambda. The role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use when they make calls to other AWS resources. For more information, see the following topics in the IAM User Guide
: IAM Roles Common Scenarios for Roles: Users, Applications, and Services Consider encryption of data at rest You have the following options for protecting data at rest in Amazon S3: Server-side encryption â All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default, and all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket are automatically encrypted at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) is the default encryption configuration for every bucket in Amazon S3. To use a different type of encryption, you can either specify the type of server-side encryption to use in your S3 PUT requests, or you can set the default encryption configuration in the destination bucket.
