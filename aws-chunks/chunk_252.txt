We recommend that your application not pin Amazon S3 TLS certificates as AWS doesnât support pinning of publicly-trusted certificates. S3 automatically renews certificates and renewal can happen any time before certificate expiry. Renewing a certificate generates a new public-private key pair. If youâve pinned an S3 certificate which has been recently renewed with a new public key, you wonât be able to connect to S3 until your application uses the new certificate.
