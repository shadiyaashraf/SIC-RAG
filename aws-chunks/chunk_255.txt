. Enable S3 Versioning S3 Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your bucket.

Also consider implementing ongoing detective controls by using the s3-bucket-versioning-enabled managed AWS Config rule.
