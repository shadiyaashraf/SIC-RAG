You need to have visibility of all your Amazon S3 resources to assess their security posture and take action on potential areas of weakness. To audit your resources, we recommend doing the following: Use Tag Editor to identify and tag security-sensitive or audit-sensitive resources, then use those tags when you need to search for these resources. For more information, see Searching for Resources to Tag in the Tagging AWS Resources User Guide
. Use S3 Inventory to audit and report on the replication and encryption status of your objects for business, compliance, and regulatory needs. For more information, see Cataloging and analyzing your data with S3 Inventory
