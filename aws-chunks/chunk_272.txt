CloudTrail supports a subset of Amazon S3 object-level API operations, such as GetObject
, DeleteObject
, and PutObject
. For more information about how CloudTrail works with Amazon S3, see Logging Amazon S3 API calls using AWS CloudTrail
. In the Amazon S3 console, you can also configure your S3 buckets to Enabling CloudTrail event logging for S3 buckets and objects
. AWS Config provides a managed rule (
cloudtrail-s3-dataevents-enabled
) that you can use to confirm that at least one CloudTrail trail is logging data events for your S3 buckets. For more information, see cloudtrail-s3-dataevents-enabled in the AWS Config Developer Guide
