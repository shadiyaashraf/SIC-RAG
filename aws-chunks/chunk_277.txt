Use S3 Storage Lens S3 Storage Lens is a cloud-storage analytics feature that you can use to gain organization-wide visibility into object-storage usage and activity. S3 Storage Lens also analyzes metrics to deliver contextual recommendations that you can use to optimize storage costs and apply best practices for protecting your data. With S3 Storage Lens, you can use metrics to generate summary insights, such as finding out how much storage you have across your entire organization or which are the fastest-growing buckets and prefixes. You can also use S3 Storage Lens metrics to identify cost-optimization opportunities, implement data-protection and access-management best practices, and improve the performance of application workloads. For example, you can identify buckets that don't have S3 Lifecycle rules to abort incomplete multipart uploads that are more than 7 days old.
