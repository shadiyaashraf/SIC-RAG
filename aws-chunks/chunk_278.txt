You can also use S3 Storage Lens metrics to identify cost-optimization opportunities, implement data-protection and access-management best practices, and improve the performance of application workloads. For example, you can identify buckets that don't have S3 Lifecycle rules to abort incomplete multipart uploads that are more than 7 days old. You can also identify buckets that aren't following data-protection best practices, such as using S3 Replication or S3 Versioning. For more information, see Understanding Amazon S3 Storage Lens
