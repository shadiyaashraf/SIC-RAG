Monitoring data security with managed AWS security services Several managed AWS security services can help you identify, assess, and monitor security and compliance risks for your Amazon S3 data. They can also help you protect your data from those risks. These services include automated detection, monitoring, and protection capabilities that are designed to scale from Amazon S3 resources for a single AWS account to resources for organizations spanning thousands of AWS accounts. AWS detection and response services can help you identify potential security misconfigurations, threats, or unexpected behaviors, so that you can quickly respond to potentially unauthorized or malicious activity in your environment. AWS data protection services can help you monitor and protect your data, accounts, and workloads from unauthorized access.
