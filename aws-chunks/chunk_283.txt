AWS detection and response services can help you identify potential security misconfigurations, threats, or unexpected behaviors, so that you can quickly respond to potentially unauthorized or malicious activity in your environment. AWS data protection services can help you monitor and protect your data, accounts, and workloads from unauthorized access. They can also help you discover sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), in your Amazon S3 data estate. To help you identify and evaluate data security and compliance risks, managed AWS security services generate findings to notify you of potential security events or issues with your Amazon S3 data. The findings provide relevant details that you can use to investigate, assess, and act upon these risks according to your incident-response workflows and policies.
