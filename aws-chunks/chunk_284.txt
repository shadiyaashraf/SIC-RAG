To help you identify and evaluate data security and compliance risks, managed AWS security services generate findings to notify you of potential security events or issues with your Amazon S3 data. The findings provide relevant details that you can use to investigate, assess, and act upon these risks according to your incident-response workflows and policies. You can access findings data directly by using each service. You can also send the data to other applications, services, and systems, such as your security incident and event management system (SIEM). To monitor the security of your Amazon S3 data, consider using these managed AWS security services.
