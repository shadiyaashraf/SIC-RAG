With the S3 protection feature in GuardDuty, you can configure GuardDuty to analyze AWS CloudTrail management and data events for your Amazon S3 resources. GuardDuty then monitors those events for malicious and suspicious activity. To inform the analysis and identify potential security risks, GuardDuty uses threat-intelligence feeds and machine learning. GuardDuty can monitor different kinds of activity for your Amazon S3 resources. For example, CloudTrail management events for Amazon S3 include bucket-level operations, such as ListBuckets
, DeleteBucket
, and PutBucketReplication
.
