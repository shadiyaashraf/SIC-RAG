Detective provides prebuilt data aggregations, summaries, and context that can help you analyze and assess the nature and extent of possible security issues. Detective automatically extracts time-based events, such as API calls from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon VPC Flow Logs for your AWS resources. It also ingests findings generated by Amazon GuardDuty. Detective then uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to generate visualizations that help you conduct effective security investigations more quickly. These visualizations provide a unified, interactive view of resource behaviors and the interactions between them over time.
