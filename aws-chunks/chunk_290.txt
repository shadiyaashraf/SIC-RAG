Detective then uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to generate visualizations that help you conduct effective security investigations more quickly. These visualizations provide a unified, interactive view of resource behaviors and the interactions between them over time. You can explore this behavior graph to examine potentially malicious actions, such as failed login attempts or suspicious API calls. You can also see how these actions affect resources, such as S3 buckets and objects. For more information, see the Amazon Detective Administration Guide
