You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to validate IAM policies against policy grammar and best practices, and generate IAM policies based on access activity in your AWS CloudTrail logs. IAM Access Analyzer uses logic-based reasoning to analyze resource policies in your AWS environment, such as bucket policies. With IAM Access Analyzer for S3, you're alerted when an S3 bucket is configured to allow access to anyone on the internet or other AWS accounts, including accounts outside your organization. For example, IAM Access Analyzer for S3 can report that a bucket has read or write access provided through a bucket access control list (ACL), a bucket policy, a Multi-Region Access Point policy, or an access point policy. For each public or shared bucket, you receive findings that indicate the source and level of public or shared access.
