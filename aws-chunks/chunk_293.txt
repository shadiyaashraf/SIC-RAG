For example, IAM Access Analyzer for S3 can report that a bucket has read or write access provided through a bucket access control list (ACL), a bucket policy, a Multi-Region Access Point policy, or an access point policy. For each public or shared bucket, you receive findings that indicate the source and level of public or shared access. With these findings, you can take immediate and precise corrective action to restore bucket access to what you intended.
