With Macie, you can automate the discovery and reporting of sensitive data in your Amazon S3 data estate to gain a better understanding of the data that your organization stores in S3. To detect sensitive data with Macie, you can use built-in criteria and techniques that are designed to detect a large and growing list of sensitive data types for many countries and regions. These sensitive data types include multiple types of personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, and credentials data. You can also use custom criteria that you defineâregular expressions that define text patterns to match and, optionally, character sequences and proximity rules that refine the results. If Macie detects sensitive data in an S3 object, Macie generates a security finding to notify you.
