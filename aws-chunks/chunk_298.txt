Security Hub CSPM then correlates and consolidates findings across providers to help you prioritize and process the most significant findings.

With Security Hub CSPM, you can assess the security and compliance status of your Amazon S3 resources, and you can do so as part of a broader analysis of your organization's security posture in individual AWS Regions and across multiple Regions.
