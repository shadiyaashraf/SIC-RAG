With Security Hub CSPM, you can assess the security and compliance status of your Amazon S3 resources, and you can do so as part of a broader analysis of your organization's security posture in individual AWS Regions and across multiple Regions. This includes analyzing security trends and identifying the highest-priority security issues. You can also aggregate findings from multiple AWS Regions, and monitor and process aggregated findings data from a single Region. For more information, see Amazon Simple Storage Service controls in the AWS Security Hub CSPM User Guide
