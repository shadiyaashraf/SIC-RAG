Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and manages all the computing resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning, automatic scaling, and logging. Because Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service, it uses a different programming paradigm than traditional web applications. The following model illustrates how Lambda works: You write and organize your code in Lambda functions
, which are the basic building blocks you use to create a Lambda application. You control security and access through Lambda permissions
, using execution roles to manage what AWS services your functions can interact with and what resource policies can interact with your code. Event sources and AWS services trigger your Lambda functions, passing event data in JSON format, which your functions process (this includes event source mappings).
