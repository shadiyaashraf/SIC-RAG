Create applications that reason through how to help a customer â Build agents that use foundation models, make API calls, and (optionally) query knowledge bases in order to reason through and carry out tasks for your customers. Adapt models to specific tasks and domains with training data â Customize an Amazon Bedrock foundation model by providing training data for fine-tuning or continued-pretraining in order to adjust a model's parameters and improve its performance on specific tasks or in certain domains. Improve your FM-based application's efficiency and output â Purchase Provisioned Throughput for a foundation model in order to run inference on models more efficiently and at discounted rates. Determine the best model for your use case â Evaluate outputs of different models with built-in or custom prompt datasets to determine the model that is best suited for your application. Prevent inappropriate or unwanted content â Use guardrails to implement safeguards for your generative AI applications.
