Lambda layers optimize code reuse and maintenance by sharing common components across multiple functions. Code signing enforce security compliance by ensuring only approved code reaches production systems. Scale and perform reliably: Concurrency and scaling controls precisely manage application responsiveness and resource utilization during traffic spikes. Lambda SnapStart significantly reduce cold start times. Lambda SnapStart can provide as low as sub-second startup performance, typically with no changes to your function code.
