Paste the following code into the index.mjs tab, replacing the code that Lambda created. export const handler = async (event, context) => { const length = event.length; const width = event.width; let area = calculateArea(length, width); console.log(`The area is $
{
area}`); console.log('CloudWatch log group: ', context.logGroupName); let data = { "area": area, }; return JSON.stringify(data); function calculateArea(length, width) { return length * width; }
