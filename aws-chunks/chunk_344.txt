The Lambda handler: Your Lambda function contains a Python function named lambda_handler
. A Lambda function in Python can contain more than one Python function, but the handler function is always the entry point to your code. When your function is invoked, Lambda runs this method. When you created your Hello world function using the console, Lambda automatically set the name of the handler method for your function to lambda_handler
