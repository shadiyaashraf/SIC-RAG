When your function is invoked, Lambda runs this method. When you created your Hello world function using the console, Lambda automatically set the name of the handler method for your function to lambda_handler
. Be sure not to edit the name of this Python function. If you do, Lambda wonât be able to run your code when you invoke your function. To learn more about the Lambda handler in Python, see Define Lambda function handler in Python
