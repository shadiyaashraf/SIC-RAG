This is called an event source mapping
. When you invoke a function, you can choose to invoke it synchronously or asynchronously. With synchronous invocation
, you wait for the function to process the event and return a response. With asynchronous invocation
, Lambda queues the event for processing and returns a response immediately. The InvocationType request parameter in the Invoke API determines how Lambda invokes your function.
