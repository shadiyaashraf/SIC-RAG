To invoke your function over IPv6, use Lambda's public dual-stack endpoints
. Dual-stack endpoints support both IPv4 and IPv6. Lambda dual-stack endpoints use the following syntax:
protocol
://lambda. us-east-1
.api.aws
You can also use Lambda function URLs to invoke functions over IPv6. Function URL endpoints have the following format:
https://
url-id
.lambda-url.
