Amazon Bedrock pricing ============================== Security in Amazon Bedrock
Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from data centers and network architectures that are built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The shared responsibility model describes this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud: Security of the cloud â AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely.
