API Gateway use cases ============================== Invoke REST APIs in API Gateway
To call a deployed API, clients submit requests to the URL for the API Gateway component service for API execution, known as execute-api
. The base URL for REST APIs is in the following format: https://
api-id
.execute-api. region
.amazonaws.com/
stage
/
where api-id is the API identifier, region is the AWS Region, and stage is the stage name of the API deployment. Important
Before you can invoke an API, you must deploy it in API Gateway.
