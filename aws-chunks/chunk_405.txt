Access management After a user is set up in IAM, they use their sign-in credentials to authenticate with AWS. Authentication is provided by matching the sign-in credentials to a principal (an IAM user, AWS STS federated principal, IAM role, or application) trusted by the AWS account. Next, a request is made to grant the principal access to resources. Access is granted in response to an authorization request if the user has been given permission to the resource. For example, when you first sign in to the console and are on the console Home page, you aren't accessing a specific service.
