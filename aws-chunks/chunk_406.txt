Access is granted in response to an authorization request if the user has been given permission to the resource. For example, when you first sign in to the console and are on the console Home page, you aren't accessing a specific service. When you select a service, the request for authorization is sent to that service and it looks to see if your identity is on the list of authorized users, what policies are being enforced to control the level of access granted, and any other policies that might be in effect. Authorization requests can be made by principals within your AWS account or from another AWS account that you trust. Once authorized, the principal can take action or perform operations on resources in your AWS account.
