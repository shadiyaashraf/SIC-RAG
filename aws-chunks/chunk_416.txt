AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports seven types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs), AWS Organizations resource control policies (RCPs), access control lists (ACLs), and session policies. IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation.
