AWS supports seven types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs), AWS Organizations resource control policies (RCPs), access control lists (ACLs), and session policies. IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, if a policy allows the GetUser action, then a user with that policy can get user information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API. When you create an IAM user, you can choose to allow console or programmatic access. If console access is allowed, the IAM user can sign in to the console using their sign-in credentials.
