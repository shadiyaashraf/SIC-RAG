RCPs limit permissions that identity-based and resource-based policies can grant to resources in accounts within your organization. RCPs do not grant permissions. Access control lists (ACLs) â Use ACLs to control which principals in other accounts can access the resource to which the ACL is attached. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they are the only policy type that does not use the JSON policy document structure. ACLs are cross-account permissions policies that grant permissions to the specified principal.
