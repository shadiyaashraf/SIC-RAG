There are two types of managed policies: AWS managed policies â Managed policies that are created and managed by AWS. Customer managed policies â Managed policies that you create and manage in your AWS account. Customer managed policies provide more precise control over your policies than AWS managed policies. Inline policies â Policies that you add directly to a single user, group, or role. Inline policies maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity.
