Adding a cross-account principal to a resource-based policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship. When the principal and the resource are in separate AWS accounts, you must also use an identity-based policy to grant the principal access to the resource. However, if a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For step-by step instructions for granting cross-service access, see IAM tutorial: Delegate access across AWS accounts using IAM roles
. The IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role trust policy
, which is attached to an IAM role.
