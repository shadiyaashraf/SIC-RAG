For step-by step instructions for granting cross-service access, see IAM tutorial: Delegate access across AWS accounts using IAM roles
. The IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role trust policy
, which is attached to an IAM role. An IAM role is both an identity and a resource that supports resource-based policies. For that reason, you must attach both a trust policy and an identity-based policy to an IAM role. Trust policies define which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume the role.
