. IAM permissions boundaries A permissions boundary is an advanced feature in which you set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. When you set a permissions boundary for an entity, the entity can perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries. If you specify a role session or user in the principal element of a resource-based policy, an explicit allow in the permission boundary is not required. However, if you specify a role ARN in the principal element of a resource-based policy, an explicit allow in the permission boundary is required.
