If you specify a role session or user in the principal element of a resource-based policy, an explicit allow in the permission boundary is not required. However, if you specify a role ARN in the principal element of a resource-based policy, an explicit allow in the permission boundary is required. In both cases, an explicit deny in the permission boundary is effective. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For more information about permissions boundaries, see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities
