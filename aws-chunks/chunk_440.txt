. AWS Organizations resource control policies (RCPs) If you enable all features in an organization, then you can use resource control policies (RCPs) to centrally apply access controls on resources across multiple AWS accounts. RCPs are JSON policies that you can use to set the maximum available permissions for resources in your accounts without updating the IAM policies attached to each resource that you own. The RCP limits permissions for resources in member accounts and can impact the effective permissions for identities, including the AWS account root user, regardless of whether they belong to your organization. An explicit deny in any applicable RCP overrides an allow in other policies that might be attached to individual identities or resources.
