In that case, the permissions from the resource-based policy are added to the role or user's identity-based policy before the session is created. The session policy limits the total permissions granted by the resource-based policy and the identity-based policy. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the session policies and the resource-based policies plus the intersection of the session policies and identity-based policies. A resource-based policy can specify the ARN of the session as a principal. In that case, the permissions from the resource-based policy are added after the session is created.
