A resource-based policy can specify the ARN of the session as a principal. In that case, the permissions from the resource-based policy are added after the session is created. The resource-based policy permissions are not limited by the session policy. The resulting session has all the permissions of the resource-based policy plus the intersection of the identity-based policy and the session policy. A permissions boundary can set the maximum permissions for a user or role that is used to create a session.
