Overview of JSON policies Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. Identity-based policies and policies used to set permissions boundaries are JSON policy documents that you attach to a user or role. Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. SCPs and RCPs are JSON policy documents with restricted syntax that you attach to the AWS Organizations' organization root, organizational unit (OU), or an account. ACLs are also attached to a resource, but you must use a different syntax.
