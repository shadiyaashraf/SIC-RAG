SCPs and RCPs are JSON policy documents with restricted syntax that you attach to the AWS Organizations' organization root, organizational unit (OU), or an account. ACLs are also attached to a resource, but you must use a different syntax. Session policies are JSON policies that you provide when you assume a role or federated user session. It is not necessary for you to understand the JSON syntax. You can use the visual editor in the AWS Management Console to create and edit customer managed policies without ever using JSON.
