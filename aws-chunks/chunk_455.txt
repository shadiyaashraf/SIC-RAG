It is not necessary for you to understand the JSON syntax. You can use the visual editor in the AWS Management Console to create and edit customer managed policies without ever using JSON. However, if you use inline policies for groups or complex policies, you must still create and edit those policies in the JSON editor using the console. For more information about using the visual editor, see Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies and Edit IAM policies
. When you create or edit a JSON policy, IAM can perform policy validation to help you create an effective policy.
