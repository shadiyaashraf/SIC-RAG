You can include more than one statement in a policy. Sid (Optional) â Include an optional statement ID to differentiate between your statements. Effect â Use Allow or Deny to indicate whether the policy allows or denies access. Principal (Required in some circumstances) â If you create a resource-based policy, you must indicate the account, user, role, or AWS STS federated user principal to which you would like to allow or deny access. If you are creating an IAM permissions policy to attach to a user or role, you cannot include this element.
