Principal (Required in some circumstances) â If you create a resource-based policy, you must indicate the account, user, role, or AWS STS federated user principal to which you would like to allow or deny access. If you are creating an IAM permissions policy to attach to a user or role, you cannot include this element. The principal is implied as that user or role. Action â Include a list of actions that the policy allows or denies. Resource (Required in some circumstances) â If you create an IAM permissions policy, you must specify a list of resources to which the actions apply.
