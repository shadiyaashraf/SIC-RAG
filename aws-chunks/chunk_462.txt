Action â Include a list of actions that the policy allows or denies. Resource (Required in some circumstances) â If you create an IAM permissions policy, you must specify a list of resources to which the actions apply. If you create a resource-based policy, it depends on the resource you're using as to whether this element is required or not. Condition (Optional) â Specify the circumstances under which the policy grants permission. To learn about these and other more advanced policy elements, see IAM JSON policy element reference
