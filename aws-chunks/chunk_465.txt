Because of the limited size of policies
, it might be necessary to use multiple policies for more complex permissions. It's also a good idea to create functional groupings of permissions in a separate customer managed policy. For example, Create one policy for IAM user management, one for self-management, and another policy for S3 bucket management. Regardless of the combination of multiple statements and multiple policies, AWS evaluates your policies the same way. For example, the following policy has three statements, each of which defines a separate set of permissions within a single account.
