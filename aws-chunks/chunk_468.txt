The Resource element in this statement is "*" (which means "all resources"). But because policies don't grant access to resources in other accounts, the user can list only the buckets in their own AWS account. The third statement lets the user list and retrieve any object that is in a bucket named amzn-s3-demo-bucket-confidential-data
, but only when the user is authenticated with multi-factor authentication (MFA). The Condition element in the policy enforces the MFA authentication. When a policy statement contains a Condition element, the statement is only in effect when the Condition element evaluates to true.
