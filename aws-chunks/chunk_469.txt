The Condition element in the policy enforces the MFA authentication. When a policy statement contains a Condition element, the statement is only in effect when the Condition element evaluates to true. In this case, the Condition evaluates to true when the user is MFA-authenticated. If the user is not MFA-authenticated, this Condition evaluates to false. In that case, the third statement in this policy does not apply and the user does not have access to the amzn-s3-demo-bucket-confidential-data bucket.
