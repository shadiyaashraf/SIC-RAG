Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary. Doing so is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later. As an alternative to least privilege, you can use AWS managed policies or policies with wildcard * permissions to get started with policies. Consider the security risk of granting your principals more permissions than they need to do their job. Monitor those principals to learn which permissions they are using.
