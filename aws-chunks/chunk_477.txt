We recommend that you review and validate all of your existing policies. IAM Access Analyzer provides over 100 policy checks to validate your policies. It generates security warnings when a statement in your policy allows access we consider overly permissive. You can use the actionable recommendations that are provided through the security warnings as you work toward granting least privilege. To learn more about policy checks provided by IAM Access Analyzer, see IAM Access Analyzer policy validation
