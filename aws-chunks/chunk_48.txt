S3 Object Lock â Prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements that require write-once-read-many (WORM) storage or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletions. S3 Replication â Replicate objects and their respective metadata and object tags to one or more destination buckets in the same or different AWS Regions for reduced latency, compliance, security, and other use cases. S3 Batch Operations â Manage billions of objects at scale with a single S3 API request or a few clicks in the Amazon S3 console. You can use Batch Operations to perform operations such as Copy
, Invoke AWS Lambda function
, and Restore on millions or billions of objects.
