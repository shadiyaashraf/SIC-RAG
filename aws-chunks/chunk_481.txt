Last accessed information also includes information about the actions that were last accessed for some services, such as Amazon EC2, IAM, Lambda, and Amazon S3. If you sign in using AWS Organizations management account credentials, you can view service last accessed information in the AWS Organizations section of the IAM console. You can also use the AWS CLI or AWS API to retrieve a report for last accessed information for entities or policies in IAM or AWS Organizations. You can use this information to identify unnecessary permissions so that you can refine your IAM or AWS Organizations policies to better adhere to the principle of least privilege.
