. Require workloads to use temporary credentials with IAM roles to access AWS A workload is a collection of resources and code that delivers business value, such as an application or backend process. Your workload can have applications, operational tools, and components that require credentials to make requests to AWS services, such as requests to read data from Amazon S3. When you're building on an AWS compute service, such as Amazon EC2 or Lambda, AWS delivers the temporary credentials of an IAM role to that compute resource. Applications written using an AWS SDK will discover and use these temporary credentials to access AWS resources, and there is no need to distribute long lived credentials for an IAM user to your workloads running on AWS.
