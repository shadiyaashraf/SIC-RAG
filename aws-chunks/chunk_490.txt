When you're building on an AWS compute service, such as Amazon EC2 or Lambda, AWS delivers the temporary credentials of an IAM role to that compute resource. Applications written using an AWS SDK will discover and use these temporary credentials to access AWS resources, and there is no need to distribute long lived credentials for an IAM user to your workloads running on AWS. Workloads that run on outside of AWS, such as your on-premises servers, servers from other cloud providers, or managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platforms, can still use temporary credentials. However, you'll need to deliver these temporary credentials to your workload. The following are ways you can deliver temporary credentials to your workloads: You can use IAM Roles Anywhere to request temporary AWS credentials for your workload using an X.509 Certificate from your public key infrastructure (PKI).
