You can call the AWS AWS STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API to request temporary AWS credentials for your workload using a JSON web token (JWT) from an IdP that is configured within your AWS account. You can request temporary AWS credentials from your IoT device using Mutual Transport Layer Security (MTLS) authentication using AWS IoT Core. Some AWS services also support integrations to deliver temporary credentials to your workloads running outside of AWS: Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Anywhere lets you run Amazon ECS tasks on your own compute resources, and delivers temporary AWS credentials to your Amazon ECS tasks running on those compute resources. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service Hybrid Nodes lets you join your compute resources running outside of AWS as nodes to an Amazon EKS cluster. Amazon EKS can deliver temporary credentials to the Amazon EKS pods running on your compute resources.
