Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service Hybrid Nodes lets you join your compute resources running outside of AWS as nodes to an Amazon EKS cluster. Amazon EKS can deliver temporary credentials to the Amazon EKS pods running on your compute resources. AWS Systems ManagerHybrid Activations lets you manage your compute resources running outside of AWS using SSM, and delivers temporary AWS credentials to the SSM agent running on your compute resources. Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) We recommend using IAM roles for human users and workloads that access your AWS resources so that they use temporary credentials. However, for scenarios in which you need an IAM user or root user in your account, require MFA for additional security.
