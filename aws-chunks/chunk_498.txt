Some of the use cases include the following: Workloads that cannot use IAM roles â You might run a workload from a location that needs to access AWS. In some situations, you can't use IAM roles to provide temporary credentials, such as for WordPress plugins. In these situations, use IAM user long-term access keys for that workload to authenticate to AWS. Third-party AWS clients â If you are using tools that donât support access with IAM Identity Center, such as third-party AWS clients or vendors that are not hosted on AWS, use IAM user long-term access keys. AWS CodeCommit access â If you are using CodeCommit to store your code, you can use an IAM user with either SSH keys or service-specific credentials for CodeCommit to authenticate to your repositories.
