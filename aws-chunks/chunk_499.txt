Third-party AWS clients â If you are using tools that donât support access with IAM Identity Center, such as third-party AWS clients or vendors that are not hosted on AWS, use IAM user long-term access keys. AWS CodeCommit access â If you are using CodeCommit to store your code, you can use an IAM user with either SSH keys or service-specific credentials for CodeCommit to authenticate to your repositories. We recommend that you do this in addition to using a user in IAM Identity Center for normal authentication. Users in IAM Identity Center are the people in your workforce who need access to your AWS accounts or to your cloud applications. To give users access to your CodeCommit repositories without configuring IAM users, you can configure the git-remote-codecommit utility.
