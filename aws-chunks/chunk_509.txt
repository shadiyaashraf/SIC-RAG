Regularly review and remove unused users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials You might have IAM users, roles, permissions, policies, or credentials that you no longer need in your AWS account. IAM provides last accessed information to help you identify the users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials that you no longer need so that you can remove them. This helps you reduce the number of users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials that you have to monitor. You can also use this information to refine your IAM policies to better adhere to least-privilege permissions. For more information, see Refine permissions in AWS using last accessed information
