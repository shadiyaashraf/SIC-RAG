You do this by reviewing the findings that IAM Access Analyzer generates. These findings help you verify that your resource access controls grant the access that you expect. Additionally, as you update public and cross-account permissions, you can verify the effect of your changes before deploying new access controls to your resources. IAM Access Analyzer also monitors supported resource types continuously and generates a finding for resources that allow public or cross-account access.
