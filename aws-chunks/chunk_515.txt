You can validate your policies by using IAM Access Analyzer policy validation. IAM Access Analyzer provides more than 100 policy checks and actionable recommendations to help you author secure and functional policies. As you author new policies or edit existing policies in the console, IAM Access Analyzer provides recommendations to help you refine and validate your policies before you save them. Additionally, we recommend that you review and validate all of your existing policies. For more information, see IAM Access Analyzer policy validation
