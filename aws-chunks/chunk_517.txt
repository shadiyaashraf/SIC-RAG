Establish permissions guardrails across multiple accounts As you scale your workloads, separate them by using multiple accounts that are managed with AWS Organizations. We recommend that you use AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) to establish permissions guardrails to control access for all principals (IAM roles and users) across your accounts. We recommend that you use AWS Organizations resource control policies (RCPs) to establish permissions guardrails to control access for AWS resources across your organization. SCPs and RCPs are types of organization policies that you can use to manage permissions in your organization at the AWS organization, organizational unit (OU), or account level. However, SCPs and RCPs alone are insufficient to grant permissions to principals and resources in your organization.
