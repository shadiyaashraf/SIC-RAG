You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. Bucket policies â Use IAM-based policy language to configure resource-based permissions for your S3 buckets and the objects in them. Amazon S3 access points â Configure named network endpoints with dedicated access policies to manage data access at scale for shared datasets in Amazon S3. Access control lists (ACLs) â Grant read and write permissions for individual buckets and objects to authorized users. As a general rule, we recommend using S3 resource-based policies (bucket policies and access point policies) or IAM user policies for access control instead of ACLs.
