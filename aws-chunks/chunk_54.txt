Access control lists (ACLs) â Grant read and write permissions for individual buckets and objects to authorized users. As a general rule, we recommend using S3 resource-based policies (bucket policies and access point policies) or IAM user policies for access control instead of ACLs. Policies are a simplified and more flexible access control option. With bucket policies and access point policies, you can define rules that apply broadly across all requests to your Amazon S3 resources. For more information about the specific cases when you'd use ACLs instead of resource-based policies or IAM user policies, see Managing access with ACLs
