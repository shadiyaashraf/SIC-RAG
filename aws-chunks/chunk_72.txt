By default, you can create up to 100 directory buckets in your AWS account, with no limit on the number of objects that you can store in a directory bucket. Directory buckets organize objects into hierarchical directories (prefixes) instead of the flat storage structure of general purpose buckets. This bucket type has no prefix limits and individual directories can scale horizontally. For more information, see Working with directory buckets
. For low-latency use cases, you can create a directory bucket in a single AWS Availability Zone to store data.
