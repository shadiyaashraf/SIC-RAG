. For low-latency use cases, you can create a directory bucket in a single AWS Availability Zone to store data. Directory buckets in Availability Zones support the S3 Express One Zone storage class. With S3 Express One Zone, your data is redundantly stored on multiple devices within a single Availability Zone. The S3 Express One Zone storage class is recommended if your application is performance sensitive and benefits from single-digit millisecond PUT and GET latencies.
