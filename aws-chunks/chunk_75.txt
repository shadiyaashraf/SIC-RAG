For data-residency use cases, you can create a directory bucket in a single AWS Dedicated Local Zone (DLZ) to store data. In Dedicated Local Zones, you can create S3 directory buckets to store data in a specific data perimeter, which helps support your data residency and isolation use cases. Directory buckets in Local Zones support the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA; Z-IA) storage class. To learn more about creating directory buckets in Local Zones, see Data residency workloads
. Note
Directory buckets have all public access disabled by default.
