S3 Tables are purpose-built for storing tabular data in the Apache Iceberg format. You can query tabular data in S3 Tables with popular query engines, including Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, and Apache Spark. By default, you can create up to 10 table buckets per AWS account per AWS Region and up to 10,000 tables per table bucket. For more information, see Working with S3 Tables and table buckets
. Note
All table buckets and tables are private and can't be made public.
