Vector buckets use dedicated API operations to write and query vector data efficiently. With S3 vector buckets, you can store vector embeddings for machine learning models, perform similarity searches, and integrate with services like Amazon Bedrock and Amazon OpenSearch. S3 vector buckets organize data using vector indexes, which are resources within a bucket that store and organize vector data for efficient similarity search. Each vector index can be configured with specific dimensions, distance metrics (like cosine similarity), and metadata configurations to optimize for your specific use case.
