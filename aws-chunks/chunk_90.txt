Every object in a bucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, object key, and optionally, version ID (if S3 Versioning is enabled for the bucket) uniquely identify each object. So you can think of Amazon S3 as a basic data map between "bucket + key + version" and the object itself. Every object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service endpoint, bucket name, key, and optionally, a version. For example, in the URL https://
amzn-s3-demo-bucket
.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg
, amzn-s3-demo-bucket is the name of the bucket and photos/puppy.jpg is the key.
