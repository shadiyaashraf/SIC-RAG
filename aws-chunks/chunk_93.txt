. Version ID When you enable S3 Versioning in a bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for each object added to the bucket. Objects that already existed in the bucket at the time that you enable versioning have a version ID of null
. If you modify these (or any other) objects with other operations, such as CopyObject and PutObject
, the new objects get a unique version ID. For more information, see Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning
