Only the bucket owner can associate a policy with a bucket. The permissions attached to the bucket apply to all of the objects in the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner. Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size. Bucket policies use JSON-based access policy language that is standard across AWS. You can use bucket policies to add or deny permissions for the objects in a bucket.
