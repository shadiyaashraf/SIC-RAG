Bucket policies use JSON-based access policy language that is standard across AWS. You can use bucket policies to add or deny permissions for the objects in a bucket. Bucket policies allow or deny requests based on the elements in the policy, including the requester, S3 actions, resources, and aspects or conditions of the request (for example, the IP address used to make the request). For example, you can create a bucket policy that grants cross-account permissions to upload objects to an S3 bucket while ensuring that the bucket owner has full control of the uploaded objects. For more information, see Examples of Amazon S3 bucket policies
